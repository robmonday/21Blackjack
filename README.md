## Description
This was a project I started when I was first learning front-end web development.  I think the script is actually pretty decent for a newbie, but overall the game could use some significant further development!  Can anybody push this forward?  This was an epic learning opportunity for me.

## Libraries Used
No outside libraries were used, however I did save a CSS file (``) as one of the files.  This is an open source work.

## Installation Instructions
To get this code running, simply save all files into the same folder.  Then open `index.html`.  That easy!
